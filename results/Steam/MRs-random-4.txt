and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [feature, price]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) superset of the source test output.

In the domain of Steam (SearchTheStore)
the following metamorphic relation should hold
MR286 (CONJUNCTIVE_EXTEND):
if a source test case is run with the inputs [sortBy, price, specialOffers, tag, selectedTypes, numberOfPlayers, feature, vrSupport, os]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [playArea]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [headsets, language]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [input]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [term]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) subset of the source test output.
