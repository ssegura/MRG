if a source test case is run with the inputs [term, price, specialOffers, selectedTypes, numberOfPlayers, feature, headsets, os]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [vrSupport]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [language, tag]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [input, playArea]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) subset of the source test output.

In the domain of Steam (SearchTheStore)
the following metamorphic relation should hold
MR225 (CONJUNCTIVE_CONTRACT):
if a source test case is run with the inputs [term, sortBy, tag, numberOfPlayers, vrSupport, headsets, input, language]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [input, language, numberOfPlayers, tag, term, vrSupport]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [headsets]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) superset of the source test output.
