and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [new_client]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) superset of the source test output.

In the domain of Prestashop (ListOrders)
the following metamorphic relation should hold
MR23 (CONJUNCTIVE_CONTRACT):
if a source test case is run with the inputs [id, reference, new_client, delivery, customer, total, payment, status, from, to, order]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [customer, delivery, id, new_client, reference, status, total]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [to]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by removing the following parameters [from]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) superset of the source test output.

In the domain of Prestashop (ListOrders)
the following metamorphic relation should hold
MR96 (DISJOINT_EXTEND):
if a source test case is run with the inputs [reference, new_client:no, customer, total, payment, status, from, to, order]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by changing the value of the following parameters [new_client:yes]
then the source and the follow-up output(s) should be disjoint.

the following metamorphic relation should hold
MR110 (CONJUNCTIVE_EXTEND):
if a source test case is run with the inputs [id, reference, new_client, delivery, customer, total, payment, order]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [from, status]
and a follow-up test case is constructed by adding the following parameters [to]
then the follow-up output(s) should be a (non-strict) subset of the source test output.
